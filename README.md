You can search users by inputting their login or just parts of it in the search form. Search results are loaded dynamically, so you will immediately see results of search. If there is more than ten search results, you just have to scroll down the page in order to load more results dynamicaly.

## Posts and comments 
Write down interesting stories of your life or anything else. You can write almost everything within 5000 symbols. Comment your friends' posts, like them and have fun. Posts on pages are loaded dynamically after you scroll down the page to bottom.

## Dialogs and messages

After creating the dialog you can always find it in the dialogs list, by clicking on "Messages" button in menu on the left side of page.

The calendar is a key function of our social network. It has wide functionality of event management. You can create and attend user-created events, see the location of the event and rate it after you have attended.

In the calendar menu there are four sections: you can see your created events in “My events” section, events you have created and already held in “Past events” section and track your following events (the ones your friends have created) in the “Following events” section. You can also see any user’s events (future and past) in his profile’s calendar menu.

The fourth section in calendar menu is called “Posts”. It contains posts you may like created by people you follow.

To create an event, press the arrow button in “My events” section and the event creation form will appear. Fill in the event name and main information about it, choose time and date, identify the location via built-in Google Maps API and you are ready to go! Click “Share an event button” and your subscribers will see this event in their calendars under the “Following events” section.

After users have attended the event, they can rate it, so in the future other users could see the creator’s past events and their rating.
